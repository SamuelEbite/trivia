# Trivia Game
This is my solution to the trivia problem set in the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course. The program implements a simple trivia game where the user is presented with a list of questions and multiple choice answers. The program keeps track of the user's score and displays it at the end of the game.

Usage

To run the program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download and install it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Download the files from the CS50 problem set repository
Navigate to the trivia directory
Run the trivia.py file using Python 3:
ruby
Copy code
$ python3 trivia.py
Follow the prompts to play the game
Files

trivia.py: The main Python program that implements the trivia game logic
questions.txt: The file containing the trivia questions and answers in the format described in the problem set instructions
Implementation Details

The trivia game is implemented using Python's built-in file input/output functionality, string manipulation, and flow control structures. The program reads in the questions.txt file and processes the questions and answers into a list of dictionaries. It then presents the questions to the user one at a time, and checks their answer against the correct answer for each question. The user's score is tallied and displayed at the end of the game.

Credits

This program was created as part of the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course offered by Harvard University. The problem set was designed by the CS50 staff. The code implementation is my own work.
